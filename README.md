Django based self-serivce firwall config tool.

The use-case is that a group of trusted users can easily configure
simple fireall rules for a set of machines. Each machine has a owner
and the rules are valid for a certain amount of time only, then they
need to be refreshed.

Supported firewalls are: cisco, ubuntu ufw
