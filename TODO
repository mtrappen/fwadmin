Prio1:
 * moderation needs a way to "disapprove" (delete)
 * user should be able to delete host
 * user should be able to hand host to different user (?)

 * send mail when a new host is waiting for moderation
   (cron or instantly?)
 * add log functionality for the edit form and when rules are
   added/removed by the user

Prio-N:
 * a common page-header menu via JS etc
 * iptables rules backend (instead of ufw one)
 * move (some) of the settings into the DB so that it can be
   edited via the admin interface(?)
